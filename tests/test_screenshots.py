    Image visual diff.

    Take two image paths and error if the pixel diff isn't within
    `allowed_mismatch`. The value of this is a bit of a magic number: there are
    minor changes between screenshots for random reasons (antialiasing, browser
    minor versions etc). These don't produce useful test fails, so we set a
    'fuzzy' diff level.

    If the test fails (the diff is over the given percent) then we write an
    image with the baseline, test and diff highlighted. This is useful for
    seeing what changed.
